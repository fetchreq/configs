A neovim configuration that looks good and is fast (0.045s ~ 0.075ms).
Has something like 26 plugins and but is still fast becuase of holy lazy loading.

## Requirements
+ Neovim
+ ripgrep (optional)
+ nodejs and npm
+ a brain (mandatory)
+ some xp with lua and neovim

## Installation

It's really easy , just a simple one liner with git!
```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/dark-Jedi2108/nvide ~/.config/nvim
```
## Custom Colorschemes
I know it sucks but you will have to do it manually
+ Make a new color scheme  `/lua/themes/colorschemes/scheme.lua` (copy the default colorscheme and change the colors) 
+ change colorscheme name at `/lua/themes/init.lua` 

```lua
local core = require('themes.colorschemes.scheme')
```

+ Reload Neovim

## Some Points To be Noted
+ This is meant to be a simple base config which can be extended and customised very easily.
+ THIS IS NOT A "DISTRO", just my personal dotfiles that i wanted to share with you guys!
+ This is not for beginners, you need to have some experience wihth lua and neovim.
